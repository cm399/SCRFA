# SCRFA

## Folder Structer 
There  is an index.html, this is the main file. 
And I created there folders for css, impages, and js. 
And I imported the images, css styles, and js script from  the seperated folder to the index.html file. 

## CSS Folder. 
I created three css files in the directory including  all.min.css, bootstrap.min.css, sytle.css. 
all.min.css and bootstrap.min.css are built-in css module, and I customized the style.css file. 

## Images Folder. 
I created a image folder to manage images easily. 
And I created another sub-directory called services in the images directory. 
So I managed the images for  icons in the directory. 

## JS folder. 
I created a custom.js in the directory and handled all functionalities in the file. 

You can run the project by double clicking the index.html file, and then you can see the result in the  browser.
